## üêõ Bug

Artifacts with .log extension are missing if there are no subsequent artifacts generated. 

### Expected behavior

All artifacts are present from  `grid artifacts` 

### Current behavior

A run with .log generated on the last step will not have that artifact available via `grid artifacts` command.

### To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the issue as follows:

| Test | Expected Results | Actual Results | Script | Runner | Run |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| at end, write weights.log then results.log | both .log files are present | the last .log is missing | [run.py](./run.py) | [unittest-run.yml](./.github/workflows/unittest-run.yml) | [![run.py](https://github.com/gridai-actions/test-log-txt-suffix-in-artifacts/actions/workflows/unittest-run.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gridai-actions/test-log-txt-suffix-in-artifacts/actions/workflows/unittest-run.yml) |
| at end, HPO run `--extension "['txt', 'log', 'hello', 'log2', 'xyz']" --sleep "[0, 60, 120]" --close_file "[0,1]"` | all 6 .log files are present | no .log files are present but all other extensions are ok | [run2.py](./run2.py) | [unittest-run2.yml](./.github/workflows/unittest-run2.yml) | [![run2.py](https://github.com/gridai-actions/test-log-txt-suffix-in-artifacts/actions/workflows/unittest-run2.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gridai-actions/test-log-txt-suffix-in-artifacts/actions/workflows/unittest-run2.yml) |
| write weights.log then results.log then some more artifacts| both .log files are present | all artifacts are found including the two .log files are present| [run.py](./run.py) | [unittest-run.yml](./.github/workflows/unittest-run.yml) | [![run3.py](https://github.com/gridai-actions/test-log-txt-suffix-in-artifacts/actions/workflows/unittest-run3.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gridai-actions/test-log-txt-suffix-in-artifacts/actions/workflows/unittest-run3.yml) |
